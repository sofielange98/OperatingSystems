File Descriptions:
- cs3753_add.c -
This file contains my actual code for my system call
The function sys_cs3753_add takes two integers and a pointer to address where an integer could be stored and copies the added together value to the pointer in the user space.

- Makefile -
I have added two lines to the make file which let the compiler know which objects to compile
In my case, adding the lines
obj-y					+= helloworld.o
obj-y					+= cs3753_add.o
lets the compiler know when we call make that I want these objects compiled also

- syscall_64.tbl -
This file assigns numbers to different system calls. This is so when you call syscall(333) it knows I am referring to the system call sys_helloworld or 334 for sys_cs3753_add

- syscalls.h -
We add the function prototype for both of our new system calls so that they are defined before any reference to them

- syslog -
The syslog verifies that my system call did do what I intended on my system because it shows the correct numbers in the output generated by the printk function

- testcall.c -
In testcall.c I test both system calls by calling them with syscall(syscallnumber)
Feel free to alter any variables to check that the system call does in fact cause the number in the c pointer to be the integer sum of a and b.

********** Instructions **********
In order to test my system call, you would simply need to replace the files on your system with the files I have submitted, then recompile, then compile and run testcall.c You wouldn't need syslog, but
-cs3753_add.c
-helloworld.c
Would need to be added to /home/kernel/linux-hwe-4.15.0/arch/x86/kernel
and
-Makefile (/home/kernel/linux-hwe-4.15.0/arch/x86/kernel)
-syscall_64.tbl (/home/kernel/linux-hwe-4.15.0/arch/x86/entry/syscalls)
-syscalls.h (/home/kernel/linux-hwe-4.15.0/include/linux)
Would all need to replace those corresponding files in those directories on your own system.
